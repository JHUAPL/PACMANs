fourbox_Aredi_noise.m superseeds the fourbox_Aredi routine in the Box model package.
Note that you have to add another parameter when you call it.

CESM2 folder contains matlab functions for reading in temperature, salinity, northward velocity, and meridional overturning circulation and producing zonal means of temperature, salinity, potential density, and northward velocity, and subsequently producing box-model style timeseries. The conditions at any individual time from the box-model-style time series can be used as initial conditions for the box model to suggest whether AMOC collapse is likely.
