Description
-----------
A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and
University of California-Davis University (UC Davis) are working to lead an effort to develop a Physics-informed AI
Climate Model Agent Neuro-symbolic Simulator (PACMANS) for Tipping Point Discovery. We aim to push climate modeling
into the third wave of AI by extending explainability and by informing climate intervention decisions or adaptation
strategies. This first of its kind comprehensive approach to climate and tipping point modeling will be enabled by a
partnership between APL researchers who excel in integrating complex AI systems to achieve scientific and
defense-oriented results and world-class experts in dynamical systems and climate systems modeling from (JHU).
