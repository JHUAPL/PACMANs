Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL)
---------------------------------------------------------

**Dr. Jennifer Sleeman** (PI; AI Simulation Group) is a Senior Machine Learning Researcher in APL’s Artificial
Intelligence Group with over 20 years of experience as an AI researcher, with a focus on climate science, weather and
artificial intelligence using deep learning for various weather pollution projects.

**Dr. Jay Brett** (Use Case Modeling, Evaluation, and Data Acquisition Groups) is a Senior Oceanographer in APL’s
Oceanic, Atmospheric, and Remote Sensing Sciences Group with expertise in numerical modeling of physical and biological
processes of the ocean. Dr. Brett studied physical oceanography in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution Joint Program and provides ocean physical modeling expertise to the Use Case Modeling,
Evaluation, and Data Acquisition groups.

Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
------------------------------
**Dr. Anand Gnanadesikan** (Co-PI; Lead of Use Case Modeling Group) is an Earth System Modeler who works on the
interactions between ocean circulation and atmosphere, biosphere and cryosphere. He has worked extensively on the
physics responsible for setting the magnitude of the AMOC.

**Dr. Yannis Kevrekidis** (Co-PI; Physics-Informed Surrogate Model Group), a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of
Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, is an applied
mathematician/computational engineer with forty years expertise in nonlinear dynamics, data driven modeling
(machine learning, manifold learning) and multiscale modeling, with an interface between traditional modeling and
ML/neural network-based modeling in physics-informed data driven models. He has extensive expertise in the machine
learning of tipping points for agent-based models.

University of California-Davis University (UC Davis)
----------------------------------------------------
**Dr. Grey Nearing** is an Assistant Professor at UC Davis and provides expertise in the area of hydrology and machine
learning.
