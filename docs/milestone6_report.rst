3 Key Findings
---------------

**Surrogate Models:

   • We have achieved the first calculation of escape time distributions
   for the 4-box model (non-dimensionalized)

**AI Simulation:

   • We showed that the GAN could be used to exploit the area of uncertainty, consistent with the separatrix of the fold bifurcations, consistent with the Gnanadesikan 2018 paper

   • By fixing the loss function to include information from the discriminator’s uncertainty and increasing the number of generators using this generative setup, as the number of generators increases, the GAN becomes more focused on this area of uncertainty

   • We believe we could extend the GAN to explore additional types of bifurcations

   • Using the CLEVR dataset we are now able to measure performance of the neuro-symbolic architectures and have strong preliminary results using Levenstein distance as a metric\ |image29|

   These are the equations that we start with (nine differential
   equations)

   
**Salt Conservation**


====== ======== ======== ======== ======
𝑑 𝑆!𝑉! + 𝑑 𝑆"𝑉" + 𝑑 𝑆#𝑉# + 𝑑 𝑆$𝑉$    = 0
                                  
       𝑑𝑡       𝑑𝑡       𝑑𝑡       
====== ======== ======== ======== ======
𝑑𝑡                                
====== ======== ======== ======== ======

Hence, we substitute to the last ODE, the algebraic constraint:

𝑆!𝑉! + 𝑆"𝑉" + 𝑆#𝑉# + 𝑆$𝑉$ = 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑡 = 𝐾

So actually, 𝑉! = 𝐴! ∗ 𝐷%&' = 0.6𝑒14 ∗ 100 and 𝑉" = 𝐴" ∗ 𝐷%&' = 1𝑒14 ∗
100 are constant, while the initial value of 𝑉(# = 2𝑒14 ∗ 𝐷(.

Knowing:

   𝑉($ = 𝑉)*) − 𝑉(! − 𝑉(" − 𝑉(# = 3700 ∗ 3.6𝑒14 − 0.6𝑒16 − 1𝑒16 − 2𝑒14 ∗
   𝐷(

The initial value of 𝐷( = 400.

The initial value of salinities are 𝑆(! = 35, 𝑆(" = 34, 𝑆(# = 36, 𝑆($ =
34.5.

We can find directly 𝑆$:

   𝑆$ = 𝐾 − 𝑆!𝑉! − 𝑆"𝑉" − 𝑆#𝑉#

𝑉$\ |image79|\ |image80|\ |image81|

   IMPORTANTLY, we explicitly used the fact that there exists an
   algebraic constraint (a salt balance) that reduces the equations by
   one, and removes a neutral direction; this helps the conditioning of
   the Jacobian

**Non-Dimensional Equations**

In order to non-dimensionalize the equations, we introduce
non-dimensional time and variables:

   | 𝑡 = 𝑡∗ ∗ 𝐴 ∗ 𝐻 , 𝐷 = 𝐻 ∗ 𝐷∗, 𝑀"#
   | S$ = S$∗S$%, S& = S&∗S$%, S' = S'∗S$%
   | T$ = T$∗T'%, T& = T&∗T'%, T' = T'∗T'%, 𝑇( = 𝑇(∗𝑇)%

   we introduce several non-dimensional constants for the Fluxes:

𝑇𝑟\* = +,- .!,.!,0"!,0#! 1$%& 2-!3() ' , 𝑀*∗ = 𝑇𝑟*Δ𝜌∗𝐷∗4; 𝑇𝑟567 =
1$%&3(), 𝑀567∗ = 8*9#+, 0-., 1∗;𝑇𝑟"((: =90;&1 1$%&;213(), 𝑀"((:∗ =
𝑇𝑟"((:𝐷∗ ; 𝑇𝑟<"(= = 93(4%90, 𝑀;.∗ = 𝑇𝑟<"(=𝑇𝑟"((:𝐷∗ ;

𝑇𝑟.1 =356 @ =>,7 . =>,13(); 𝑇𝑟>? 3() 𝑇𝑟>? 3()

   To make computations more accurate numerically, we
   non-dimensionalized the equations in ways **meaningful to the domain
   scientist** (Anand G.) to reduce the number of free parameters



**Numerical Bifurcation Analysis**

   .. image:: _static/media6/image89.png
      :width: 3.61806in
      :height: 2.71389in

   .. image:: _static/media6/image90.png
      :width: 3.44167in
      :height: 2.58055in


   The Hysteretic behavior found in [Gnanadesikan, Kelson, Sten 2018],
   can be described as:

   	The ‘switching’ between ‘off’ and ‘on’ state is given by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation: H for 𝑇𝑟>?\* = 0.03529

   	And a saddle-node bifurcation: LP for 𝑇𝑟>?\* = 0.01798

	Reminder: we found two different tipping points ("up to down" and "down to up” that also happened to do be of different nature ("turning point" and "subcritical Hopf")
\ |image93|\ |image94|\ |image95|\ |image96|



**Stochastic version**


To the non-dimensional system of 8 equations, we add fluctuations in the fresh water flux coefficient: :math:`𝑇𝑟_{FW}^n ∼ 𝒩(𝑇𝑟_{FW0}^n, 𝜎^2)`

With :math:`𝜎 = 4% 𝑇𝑟_{FW}^n = 0.002`

.. image:: _static/media6/image27.png
   :width: 13.33333in
   :height: 0.41667in

|image97|\ |image98|

| • Sitting close to the subcritical Hopf tipping point, on its "safe side" we performed our first stochastic simulations (with fluctuating freshwater flux coefficient, again designed in collaboration with the domain expert, Anand G.)
| • Notice on the left the simulations, the variable **oscillates over time near 4.7 before it eventually "tips"** 
| • Notice also, on the right, some initial statistics of **escape times** for a fixed parameter value


**AI Surrogate Learning Progress**
Next Steps:
	• We started collecting data towards a targeted surrogate model. This will allow us to efficiently and accurately estimate escape time distributions.

	• We will learn targeted effective stochastic DEs (one-dimensional at the LP tipping, two-dimensional at the Hopf tipping) and use them to estimate escape time statistics in both cases.

	• We have a very good handle on data-driven causality; the enabling tools are “Alternating Diffusion” / “Jointly Smooth Functions”

	• **We plan to use this in the discovery of good predictors/advance indicators of tipping.** |image99|


4 Task 4.4: AI Simulation Progress Summary
------------------------------------------

   *Subtask Description: We will provide a progress report of the early
   proof of concept experimental results for the MA-GAN, the causal
   model and the neuro-symbolic models, including isolated experimental
   results and early integration results.*

   | Accomplishments:
   | • Showed that the GAN could be used to exploit the area of uncertainty consistent with the separatrix in the Gnanadesikan 2018 paper
   | • Developed architectures needed for a baseline neuro-symbolic language that enables a translation from human-specific questions to the GAN simulation, and from perturbed GAN runs to questions
   | • Begun integrating the neuro-symbolic work with GAN output\ |image100|


**AI Simulation – GAN Uncertainty Experiment Objective**

   | • Initial Questions:
   	| • How does increasing generators affect learning behavior?

   	| • How should we modify the loss function (best function for finding optimal gradients of model) for this problem domain?

   | • Can the GAN discover input configurations for a climate model whose outputs are unstable or uncertain?

	| • i.e. explore separatrix

   | • How well can the GAN accurately predict the climate model outputs for configurations spanning these regions of uncertainty?\ |image101|


**AI Simulation – GAN Uncertainty Experiments**

• Reproduced one of the Box model simulation experiments to validate the GAN architecture

• With a vector of 3 dimensions and perturbations of parameters (bounded):

   • Dlow0 (Thermocline depth of lower latitudes): [100.0, 400.0]
   • Mek (Ekman flux from the southern ocean): [1.5e7, 3.5e7]
   • Fwn (Fresh water flux (North)): [5.0e4, 1.55e6]

• Other variables were held constant\ |image102|

|image103|\ |image104|



**AI Simulation – GAN Uncertainty Experiment Discriminator**

   • Given a configuration, the discriminator has two objectives:

   	• Identify the origin of the configuration (i.e. which generator produced it or if it was sampled from the real data distribution)

   	• Correctly predict if the configuration will induce a shutoff state

   • At each update step, the discriminator will achieve these two objectives for m(n+1) configurations (m samples per each of n generators, +1 batch from the real data distribution)

   • Ground-truth shutoff labels are determined for the generated configurations by consulting the surrogate model before the training step\ |image105|



**AI Simulation – GAN Uncertainty Experiment Generator**

   • *n* Generators:

   	• for i=1,…, n

   		• Generator *i* (𝐺𝑖 ) produces m configurations for the surrogate model (m = batch size)

   		• The generated configurations are passed through the discriminator to compute both the GAN logits and the AMOC state classification logits

   • Each generator has two objectives:

   	• Guide the discriminator into predicting that its configurations are sampled from the real data distribution

   	• Generate model configurations where the discriminator is least certain about the output state (i.e. AMOC shutoff vs. non-shutoff)\ |image106|



**AI Simulation – GAN Uncertainty Experiments**

	\ |image107|\ |image108|

   • Real dataset generated by uniformly sampling vectors of perturbed variables from bounded 3-D subspace.

   • Goal of GAN is to learn a distribution that explores this space, but with a bias to identify regions of AMOC instability (e.g. bifurcation region)

   • Number of generators varied (*n* = 1, 2, 3)

   • Evaluation metrics:

   	• Percentage of generated samples within the bifurcation region

   	• Discriminator shutoff classification metrics (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices)

		•    Test/generated sets

 		• Inside/outside bifurcation region
